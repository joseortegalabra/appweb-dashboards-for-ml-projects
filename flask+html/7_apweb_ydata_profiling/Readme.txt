There are two folders:
- cloudrun_y_data_profiling: this folder has codes to develop a simple app with flask+html where the user upload a dataset
and get the report .html output of ydata-profiling. The idea is has a simple app web where the user can upload big datasets
and in the cloud execute the codes
	OBS: this proyect is inconclused, there a rule system when the dataset is bigger, but in the future the idea is send a job to run this bigger datasets

- examples_y_data_profiling: this codes has codes of examples how to use ydata-profiling (previuos name: pandas-profiling)
